        Hello, I am Keshav Krishnan and I am currently a web developer and an English student at Drexel University. Outside of web development, I enjoy writing, Dungeons & Dragons, and livestreaming. I have always enjoyed coding, but web development caught my interest recently. Most of my prior experience was from physics and engineering classes. I went from programming in Python and working with arduinos and other microcontrollers to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I enjoyed building websites a lot, and decided to take a the UT Coding Bootcamp to refine my skills and learn more, especially since web development was outside of my comfort zone.
